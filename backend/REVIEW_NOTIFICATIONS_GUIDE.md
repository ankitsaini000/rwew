## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Review Controller Updates

**Create Review Notification** (`createReview`):
```typescript
// Create notification for the creator about the new review
const creatorNotification = await Notification.create({
  user: order.creator,
  type: 'order',
  message: `${brandUser.fullName || brandUser.username || 'A client'} has left you a ${rating}-star review!`,
  fromUser: brandId,
  isRead: false
});

// Emit real-time notification to creator
const io = require('../sockets').getIO();
io.to(order.creator.toString()).emit('newNotification', {
  notification: {
    ...creatorNotification.toObject(),
    fromUser: {
      _id: brandId,
      fullName: brandUser.fullName || brandUser.username || 'Client',
      avatar: brandUser.avatar
    }
  }
});
```

**Update Review Notification** (`updateReview`):
```typescript
// Create notification for the creator about the review update
const creatorNotification = await Notification.create({
  user: review.creatorId,
  type: 'order',
  message: `${brandUser.fullName || brandUser.username || 'A client'} has updated their review to ${updatedReview.rating} stars!`,
  fromUser: brandId,
  isRead: false
});
```

**Delete Review Notification** (`deleteReview`):
```typescript
// Create notification for the creator about the review deletion
const creatorNotification = await Notification.create({
  user: creatorId,
  type: 'order',
  message: `${brandUser.fullName || brandUser.username || 'A client'} has removed their review.`,
  fromUser: brandId,
  isRead: false
});
```

#### 2. Notification Types

| Action | Notification Type | Message | Recipient |
|--------|------------------|---------|-----------|
| Submit Review | `order` | "Client has left you a 5-star review!" | Creator |
| Update Review | `order` | "Client has updated their review to 4 stars!" | Creator |
| Delete Review | `order` | "Client has removed their review." | Creator |

#### 3. Error Handling

- Notifications are created in try-catch blocks
- Main operations succeed even if notifications fail
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### Frontend Integration

#### 1. Notification Display

Notifications appear in:
- **Notification dropdown** in the header
- **Notifications page** (`/notifications`)
- **Real-time updates** via Socket.io

#### 2. Navigation

When creators click on review notifications:
- Redirects to creator dashboard
- Shows relevant review information
- Maintains notification context

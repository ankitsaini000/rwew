# Backend Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to improve backend loading times and overall application performance.

## Database Optimizations

### Connection Pooling
- Implemented connection pooling to reuse database connections
- Added connection caching to prevent redundant connection attempts
- Optimized MongoDB connection parameters:
  - Increased connection pool size to 50 connections
  - Set minimum pool size to 10 connections
  - Added connection timeouts and socket timeouts
  - Configured idle connection management

### Database Indexing
- Added strategic indexes to the User model:
  - Single field indexes on frequently queried fields (email, role)
  - Compound indexes for common query patterns:
    - `{ role: 1, isActive: 1 }` - For querying active users by role
    - `{ email: 1, role: 1 }` - For authentication with role check
    - `{ facebookId: 1 }` - For Facebook login (sparse index)
    - `{ username: 1 }` - For username lookup (sparse index)
    - `{ isVerified: 1, role: 1 }` - For verified users by role

- Added indexes to DeviceSession model:
  - `{ userId: 1 }` - For querying user sessions
  - `{ sessionToken: 1 }` - For session authentication (unique index)
  - `{ lastActive: -1 }` - For sorting by most recent activity

- Added indexes to DeactivatedAccount model:
  - `{ userId: 1 }` - For unique user identification (unique index)
  - `{ email: 1 }` - For email lookup
  - `{ deactivatedAt: -1 }` - For sorting by deactivation date

- Added indexes to BrandRecommendation model:
  - `{ brand_id: 1 }` - For unique brand identification (unique index)
  - `{ last_updated: -1 }` - For sorting by update date
  - `{ recommended_creators: 1 }` - For creator-based queries

## Express Server Optimizations

### Response Compression
- Added `compression` middleware to compress HTTP responses
- Reduces bandwidth usage and improves load times for clients

### Security Enhancements
- Configured `helmet` middleware with appropriate settings
- Optimized CORS configuration with specific origins and methods

### Static File Serving
- Added caching for static files (1 day cache duration)
- Enabled ETag support for efficient caching

### Request Parsing
- Added size limits to JSON and URL-encoded request bodies (10MB)
- Prevents large payload attacks

### Session Management
- Optimized session configuration:
  - Disabled unnecessary session resaves
  - Set secure cookies in production
  - Added HTTP-only flag for cookies
  - Set appropriate session timeout (24 hours)

## Logging Optimizations

- Conditional logging based on environment:
  - Detailed logging in development
  - Error-only logging in production

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on server response times and database query performance
2. **Further Indexing**: Add indexes to other frequently queried collections
3. **Caching Layer**: Consider adding Redis for caching frequently accessed data
4. **Query Optimization**: Review and optimize complex database queries
5. **Load Testing**: Conduct load tests to identify bottlenecks under high traffic

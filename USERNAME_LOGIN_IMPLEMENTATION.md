# Username Login Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability for users to login using either their email address or username, providing more flexibility in the authentication process.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. User Controller (`backend/src/controllers/userController.ts`)
- **Modified `loginUser` function** to accept either `email` or `username` in the request body
- **Updated validation** to check for either email or username (not both required)
- **Enhanced user lookup** to search by email or username based on what's provided
- **Improved error messages** to be more generic (e.g., "Invalid email/username or password")

#### 2. User Model (`backend/src/models/User.ts`)
- **No changes required** - the `username` field already existed in the schema
- The model already supports username storage and validation

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. AuthContext (`frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **Updated interface** to use `identifier` instead of `email` parameter
- **Modified login function** to accept a generic identifier (email or username)
- **Updated function signature** in `AuthContextType` interface

#### 2. API Service (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- **Enhanced login function** to detect if the identifier is an email or username
- **Updated request payload** to send the appropriate field (email or username)
- **Fixed mock login** to work with the new identifier parameter
- **Updated error messages** to be more generic

#### 3. Login Page (`frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`)
- **Changed input field** from "Email address" to "Email or Username"
- **Updated placeholder text** to "Enter your email or username"
- **Modified input type** from "email" to "text" to accept usernames
- **Updated validation messages** to mention both email and username
- **Enhanced error handling** to show appropriate messages for both login methods

#### 4. Admin Login Page (`admin/src/app/login/page.tsx`)
- **Applied same changes** as the main login page for consistency
- **Updated form validation** and error messages

## How It Works

### Backend Logic
1. The login endpoint receives either `email` or `username` in the request body
2. The controller validates that at least one identifier is provided
3. Based on the presence of `@` symbol, it determines if the identifier is an email
4. The user lookup is performed using the appropriate field:
   - If email is provided: `User.findOne({ email })`
   - If username is provided: `User.findOne({ username })`
5. Password validation remains the same regardless of login method

### Frontend Logic
1. The login form accepts any text input (email or username)
2. The API service automatically detects the input type:
   - If input contains `@`: treated as email
   - If input doesn't contain `@`: treated as username
3. The appropriate field is sent to the backend API
4. Error handling is consistent for both login methods

## Benefits

1. **User Flexibility**: Users can choose their preferred login method
2. **Better UX**: Usernames are often easier to remember than email addresses
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing email login functionality remains unchanged
4. **Consistent Experience**: Both login methods provide the same user experience

## Testing

A test script (`test-username-login.js`) has been created to verify:
- Email login (existing functionality)
- Username login (new functionality)
- Invalid credentials handling
- Missing credentials validation

## Security Considerations

- Both login methods use the same password validation
- Username uniqueness is enforced at the database level
- Error messages are generic to prevent username enumeration
- Rate limiting and other security measures apply to both methods

## Future Enhancements

1. **Username Validation**: Add client-side validation for username format
2. **Login History**: Track which method (email vs username) was used for login
3. **Preference Setting**: Allow users to set their preferred login method
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Extend 2FA support for username login
